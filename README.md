## 🧠 About Me

I'm a student exploring **Machine Learning and Data Science**, currently focused on building strong foundations in **mathematics, algorithms, and statistical thinking**.

I enjoy understanding *why* models work — not just using libraries. My goal is to grow into an **AI/ML Engineer** capable of designing intelligent systems grounded in both theory and real-world implementation.

Most of my learning involves experimenting with data, implementing concepts from scratch, and gradually building practical AI applications.
